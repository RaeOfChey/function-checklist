## Description
FuncTastic is a JavaScript function checklist and tracker that helps developers efficiently manage and monitor their JavaScript functions. It allows users to input, track, and update function details like scope, dependencies, and execution status, providing a clear and organized view of each function's role and state within the project. With an intuitive interface, developers can expand on function details, edit them, and track their usage, making FuncTastic an essential tool for managing function behavior in growing codebases.
